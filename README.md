## About Me
I’m **Faiz Ali**, a developer with a product mindset.

I focus on building SaaS experiences that are:
- easy to adopt,
- measurable in business impact,
- and fast to iterate.

I enjoy owning work end-to-end — from problem framing and UX flow to implementation and delivery.

---

## SaaS Positioning
**How I approach product work:**
- Define success before building (activation, conversion, retention, churn signals)
- Ship in small, testable increments
- Use user feedback and usage data to prioritize what comes next
- Balance UX quality with delivery speed

> I optimize for outcomes, not just output.

## Project Showcase
| Project | What it solves | Product impact focus | Stack |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Onboarding Experience Redesign** | Users dropped off before reaching the first value moment. | Improved onboarding clarity, reduced friction, and increased activation readiness. | React, TypeScript, Tailwind |
| **Feature Adoption Dashboard** | Product teams lacked clear visibility into usage trends. | Enabled faster roadmap decisions using adoption and retention signals. | Next.js, APIs, Data Visualization |
| **Automation Workflow Toolkit** | Repetitive internal processes slowed delivery. | Reduced operational overhead and improved team throughput. | Node.js, Automation Scripts |
